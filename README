- tested with xchat version 2.8.8

INSTALLATION

- copy xchat-speak.py to ~/.xchat2

if festival is working, when xchat starts, it should say "speech activated".
it should speek all PRIVMSGs on all channels out loud.
if two folks post at the same time, both are spoken concurrently.

COMMANDS IN XCHAT

/speechon will turn speech on
/speechoff will turn speech off

BUGS
- had lots of aplay processes build up at start, one for each message
