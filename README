- tested with xchat version 2.8.8

INSTALLATION

- copy xchat-speak.py to ~/.xchat2

if festival is working, when xchat starts, it should say "speech activated".
it should speek all PRIVMSGs on all channels out loud.
if two folks post at the same time, both are spoken concurrently.

COMMANDS IN XCHAT

/speechon = turn speech on
/speechoff = turn speech off
/channelon = speak the current channel only
/channeloff = speak all channels

BUGS
- had lots of aplay processes build up at start once, one for each message
